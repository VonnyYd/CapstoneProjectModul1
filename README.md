After learning the basics of programming with Python in class, each student of the Data Science & Machine Learning program at Purwadhika Digital Technology School is assigned a task to create a simple program with a minimum of 4 main functions: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. I created a student grade data program.  

Create, Read, Update, and Delete, often abbreviated as CRUD, are fundamental operations in data management and widely used in the development of applications and database-based systems. These functions refer to the basic operations that can be performed on data within a database or information system. They enable users or applications to efficiently and systematically manage data. Here is an explanation of each function:  
1. Create:  
The Create function is used to add new data to a database or information system. In this operation, new data will be inserted into the appropriate table or data structure according to the predefined schema.
2. Read:  
The Read function is used to retrieve or read data from a database or information system. With this function, we can display existing data stored in the database.
3. Update:  
The Update function is used to modify or update existing data in a database. With this function, we can change specific values of an entity or data record.
4. Delete:  
The Delete function is used to remove data from a database or information system. With this function, we can delete entities or data records that are no longer needed or relevant.
